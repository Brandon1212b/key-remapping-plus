#NOTE: This is a copy of key reampping plus which is a copy of key remapping. Since both no longer receive updates I made this to add support for mouse remapping

# Key Remapping Plus
This plugin is an exact copy of the official Key Remapping plugin,
with the following features that can be configured in the plugin settings.

* Prompt Text: Enter any text to replace the default "Press Enter to Chat..." text. This can be blank.
* Prompt Color: Choose the desired color for the prompt text.
* Ignore Interfaces: Configures whether this plugin will continue to remap your Fkeys when an interface it open.

Notes:
* If the client doesn't update right away after changing the prompt text or color,
press any key with the game focused to pick up the change.
* Only this plugin or Key Remapping, not both, can be enabled at the same time.
